# PANTOMATH-Parental Application

The proposed Panto-math system that will help the parents to trace their child with the help of an android application. My system contains two android applications. One for child module and other one for the parent module. The child module is an android phone. The GPS system will find the current location and will send that data to the parent’s application. The parent can view the current address of the child and can also trace him in the Google Map. The parent will get the attendance report based on the location of the child. While the child enter into the school location present report will be sent and while leaving the school absent report will be sent. The parent has the provision to set the school region. And the system provides the facility for emergency call. While a message “call” send to the parent module it automatically generates a call into the number which we provided. In our system child do not have any provision to change the settings. 

Pantomath is a complete solution for ensuring the safety of kids. Now a day the crimes against children are widely increasing. While a crime happens against the child we didn’t have any option to find the current location of our child. This system provides the facility to find the location of child simply with the help of an android mobile. This system will provide exact address of current location with great accuracy. Now a day many crimes are there against children. Each parent can monitor the movements of their children by using this android application. In this paper, I use GPS system to trace the location of the child. There are mainly two modules and a database is there for my system. One is parent module which can be an android mobile phone with the application in it. The child module can be either an android mobile, android watch or Android navigators. The database is used to monitor the location of the child. Which can be connected to the school for monitoring the movements of children with in the school its self. The call list from the child phone, the message list from the child, the list of installed applications are also can be fetched by the parent. Also parent can add the reminder for the child.

Using electronic devices is not limited to adults or to specific time or place, Children use different types of mobile devices with no constraints. Guardians concern about the effect of the technical explosion on their children development. Controlling, monitoring and managing approaches are in need to help in overcoming some of these worries. This project gives insight in approaches to monitor and control children electronic devices. The project includes an overview of the related research efforts that allow guardians to manage and monitor data, applications, or services available in kid’s mobile devices. The main challenge is to balance privacy and flexibility with the ease of use. The project also includes the implementation of an android application called PANTOMATH: Parental application. 

**INTRODUCTION**

On the digital century where technology reaches kids hands, guardians may worry about the effect of this very open world on their kids’ development. They may worry about the detrimental effect of this technology on their educational, emotional and social developments. To help overcome some of these worries, guardians may need to have some controlling technology to check and track their children usage for the personal devices. As tablet devices are one of the most used technologies by children on our society, guardians will need to have some automated technologies to observe and supervise the time and quality of their children’s usage for these tablets. 

Monitoring and controlling methodologies and approaches have been developed as the technologies are started or developed.  As human being, there are some concerns when using emerging technology.  These concerns push developers to innovate ways to test, control, and manage new technologies.  One of the most known approaches is based on the use of distributed architecture for the monitoring and controlling connected devices. This distributed design allows for central controlling component over the connected devices either using client server approach, or mobile data management approach which will be the focus on this survey to monitor mobile devices. This survey is the base to help building up the proposed project, which will research the different methods available for technology usage surveillance. The project will focus more on the parental control over children’s tablet devices. Furthermore, the project will develop a controlling application for parental use on children’s tablet devices.  The proposed application may help guardians to not only control, but also evaluate the way their children handle and utilize the technologies available at their tablet devices.  This survey is the base part of the project that includes the background for researching and developing the proposed application. The structure for this survey includes the background, the research challenges, applications, and overview of related work. The background reviews the security and network methodologies related to the main focus, and explains the main terminologies used in the related work.  Then the survey includes the main difficulties that would face researchers on this area.  Despite these challenges, there are vital applications for the monitoring and controlling concepts for education and work environment, which will be covered under the application part of this survey.  Then the survey includes deeper insight on some experiments, studies, and methods related to monitoring and controlling mobile devices. 

**OVERVIEW**

Monitoring and controlling system can be used for different purposes. The aimed research and system after this survey mainly supports guardians wanting to control their children access to mobile devices and to trace their location using GPS system. Future application may be built upon using the same core idea can help gathering data from different areas to support researches on how children use their electronic devices. Such study may use big data analysis to understand patterns in children behaviour using mobile devices. 

Another application is for schools and universities to manage the usage of the compu0ters or any other electronic devices at the schools’ labs.  Teachers and professors can use controlling systems to set policies and define permission to access specific software. Researchers, also, may use monitoring systems to study the way students utilize their lab time.  Furthermore, employers can use managing and controlling systems to evaluate electronic devices usage during work.  The usage evaluation, either for students or employees, can not only affect productivity using electronic devices, but also affect overall performance. It may also lead to enhance the choices for software and applications needed in schools or work devices.   

On the other hand, software developers need to utilize some controlling managing tools through the testing phase.  Software testing may include a monitoring system for evaluating the components and the function required as proprieties from the software users. 

**Advantages of proposed system**
  
•	Real-Time tracking. 

•	Complete access to child’s data. 

•	Possibility to add more children to parent’s module. 

•	Prevents the child from going to restricted site. 

**MODULAR DESCRIPTION**
 
The concept of this parental application is implanted by three main modules. 
1.	Admin. 
2.	Parent module. 
3.	Child module. 
 
**Admin module**

•	The admin module is a web page. 

•	First the admin needs to login to the web page created. 

•	In this module the admin can add sites or words those need not to be accessed or browsed by the child. 

•	He or she can manage the block-list also. 

•	The only person who can access these above mentioned options are strictly admin.
